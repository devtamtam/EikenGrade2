        <p>In many countries, it is common for students to wear school uniforms. This tradition has been a part of the education system for many years, and it continues to be practiced in numerous schools around the world.</p>
        <p>School uniforms offer several benefits. They create a sense of unity and belonging among students, no matter their family's financial situation. Uniforms also make the morning routine easier for both students and parents, as there's no need to decide what to wear each day. Additionally, uniforms can help students focus on their studies rather than on fashion trends.</p>
        <p>However, some schools have decided to stop requiring uniforms. Critics say that uniforms limit students' ability to express themselves and show their personality. They believe that allowing students to choose their own clothes can encourage creativity and personal growth. Moreover, buying uniforms can be expensive for some families, especially those with several children in school.</p>
